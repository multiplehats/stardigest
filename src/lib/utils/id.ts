// An ID collision is when the same ID is generated twice. If this happens seldomly, itâ€™s not a big deal.
// The application can detect a collision, auto-generate a new ID, and move on. If this is happening often though, it can be a huge problem.
// The longer and more complex the ID, the less likely it is to happen. Determining the complexity needed for the ID depends on the application.
// In our case, we used the NanoID collision tool and decided to use 12 character long IDs with the alphabet of 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.
// This gives us a 1% probability of a collision in the next ~35 years if we are generating 1,000 IDs per hour.
// If we ever need to increase this, the change would be as simple as increasing the length in our ID generator and updating our database schema to accept the new size.
