# StarDrip

Stardrip is a simple newsletter that sends you a weekly email with a random GitHub repository that you've starred. It's easy to forget what you've starred over the years - Stardrip serves as a reminder.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install` start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.
