# StarDigest

StarDigest is a newsletter that sends you a daily or weekly roundup with your starred Github repo's (you know, so you don't forget about they exist). You don't have to lift a finger, just star and we'll do the rest.

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```
